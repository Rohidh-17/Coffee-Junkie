# Coffee-Shop

<b>PROBLEM:</b><br>
The local coffee shop seeks to increase customers coming to the shop and using a website to promote sales.
The coffee shop seeks to enhance their brand with a simple, mobile-first, website that showcases
their coffee. A site map consisting of various pages including Home, About, Coffee, and Contact.

<b>ACTION:</b><br>
To prototype the website, Material Bootstrap was used to quickly create the layout of the website following the site map.
The website follows a mobile-first design scheme, focusing on responsive design.

<b>SOLUTION:</b><br>
The main slider of the Home page showcases a video background. A call to action is displayed with clean, bold, and easy to read fonts.
The About page features a stylistic display of images and text. A short description about the core values of the shop is displayed.

<b>Description:</b><br>
Material Bootstrap theme for a local coffee shop.
